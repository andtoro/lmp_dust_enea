# Abstract 
Aerosols play a crucial role in influencing climate, air quality and, consequently, human health. Natural
aerosols, such as desert dust, sea salt, pollen and volcanic ash, are the main constituents of primary atmospheric
aerosols.
The Mediterranean basin is often affected by dust outflows from the Sahara Desert, which influence the
regional energy balance, biogeochemical cycles and air quality in a heavily populated region that, according to
climate models, is very sensitive to extreme weather phenomena related to climate change.
The isolated (the nearest coast is ~150 km away), rocky, small (~20 km
2), and flat (higher elevation ~130 m)
island of Lampedusa, situated in the center of the Mediterranean basin, provides an ideal location for studying
Saharan dust transport events, not being influenced by relevant local anthropogenic emissions of aerosol, and
being representative of the central Mediterranean basin.
The aim of this work is to evaluate the capability of the ENEA MINNI-FORAIR-IT air quality model to
simulate the Saharan outflows during the annual period 1
st Sep 2023 – 31
st Aug 2024; this chemical transport
model provides hourly air pollutant fields over Italy with a spatial resolution of about 4 km.
The Saharan outflows have been evaluated in terms of columnar amount using observations of Aerosol Optical
Depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent carried out at the ENEA Station for Climate Observation of Lampedusa.
The Station is part of NASA’s Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), and is an Italian facility of the Aerosol,
Clouds and Trace Gasses European Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS).
Desert aerosol transport events were identified through AOD and Ångström exponent measurements and
compared with AOD values simulated by MINNI-FORAIR-IT; the model implements both an AOD
calculation based on Mie theory and one based on a parameterization derived from the IMPROVE (Interagency
Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) network originally developed by the United States EPA
(Environmental Protection Agency) to quantitatively link aerosol amount to visibility. Comparisons between
the simulated and measured AOD values are presented and discussed both in terms of singles episodes and as
daily averages. The main differences between simulated and observed AOD are identified and discussed.
Moreover, a simple correction of the desert dust coefficient of the IMPROVE empirical formula is proposed.
The insights gained from this work could also help to design air quality policies and strategies to mitigate the
impact of aerosols on both human health and the environment, by separating natural contributions from
anthropogenic ones
