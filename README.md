# Introduction 
Climate is a complex, dynamic, system composed of multiple components, including the
atmosphere, ocean, continental surfaces, ice sheets, and living organisms. These subsystems
interact in highly nonlinear ways, influencing global climate patterns. The atmosphere is one
of the most essential components of our planet, acting as a protective shield that sustains life
on Earth. It is divided into distinct layers, each with unique characteristics, such as variations
in temperature, pressure, and density. Among these layers, the troposphere is of primary
interest, as it is where life takes place. Within the troposphere, the boundary layer plays a
crucial role in regulating atmospheric dynamics by facilitating mechanical and convective
turbulence, which mixes air masses throughout the atmospheric column. Here, both an-
thropogenic and natural emissions disperse and interact with the atmosphere, undergoing
mechanical and chemical transformations that involve numerous chemical species. Since the
Industrial Revolution and the beginning of standardized temperature monitoring (around
1850-1900), human activities, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, have unequivocally
contributed to global temperature increases. Geological observations further allow us to
estimate temperature trends from past epochs. According to major research institutions
such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Earth’s temperature has risen by approximately 1.2°C since
the pre-industrial era. These rising temperatures are linked to widespread adverse effects, in-
cluding threats to food and water security, mass mortality events, biodiversity and ecosystem
losses, as well as an increase in extreme weather events. Among these factors, aerosols, highly
heterogeneous in composition, play a crucial role in determining air quality and, consequently,
human health. Additionally, they significantly impact Earth’s energy balance due to their
strong interactions with solar radiation and their role in cloud’s formation. Extreme weather
events, such as cloud formation, precipitation, volcanic eruptions, dust storms, and wildfires,
also cause substantial changes in atmospheric composition and dynamics. Aerosol particles,
in particular, have demonstrated a cooling effect on Earth’s surface, partially counteracting
the warming effects of greenhouse gases. For example, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo
led to a global temperature decrease of approximately 0.5°C for 1-2 years.
This thesis focuses on the optical properties of aerosols, specifically Aerosol Optical Depth
(AOD) and Ångström Exponents (ANG), due to their significance as indicators of aerosol
characteristics in the atmosphere. Natural aerosols, such as desert dust, sea salt, and volcanic
ash, are the primary constituents of atmospheric aerosol. This study particularly emphasizes
desert dust because of its strong influence on the radiative balance and particulate matter
levels. The Mediterranean region is often affected by dust outflow from Sahara and is highly
sensitive to extreme weather linked to climate change like, for example, the North Atlantic
Oscillation. Lampedusa Island, situated in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, provides
an ideal location for studying dust events, as it is distant from major anthropogenic aerosol
sources and representative of the Mediterranean basin. To analyze aerosols, multiple data
sources have been used, including both ground-based observations and model simulations.
A one-year subset of observations was selected from a longer observational record at the
Lampedusa Climate Observatory, which is managed by the Italian National Agency for New
Technologies, Energy, and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA). The observatory
is part of NASA’s Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), a global network of monitoring
stations dedicated to measuring aerosol optical properties and it is a national facility of the
Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gasses European Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS). These
observations are compared with modeled data from the ENEA MINNI-FORAIR-IT air
quality model. The core of this model, used in this work, is the Flexible Air Quality Regional
Model (FARM), which simulates aerosol concentrations over Italy. Atmospheric diffusion
models are fundamental tools to assess out knowledge of aerosol dynamics and interactions,
but one of the main difficulties is due to the high aerosol variability in space and time. The
uncertainties mainly concern the estimation of the source term and the accurate prediction of
wind direction. Our first aim is to compare the AOD values obtained from the FARM model
with those measured at the Lampedusa observatory, so to evaluate model performance and
identify potential issues in model’s predictions, comparing results also with the Copernicus
Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) data and the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian
Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. The second objective of this study is to calibrate
and test the IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) for-
mula, originally developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
quantitatively link aerosol presence to visibility, as aerosols contribute to haze and reduced
visibility. The novelty of this work lies in testing new AOD parameterizations to improve
aerosol forecasting, by specifically selecting desert dust events from observations carried
out at the Lampedusa Observatory. New approaches are proposed to assess the validity
of the IMPROVE coefficients and suggest updated ones, using a methodology that could
be extended to other sources and locations. Moreover, the proposed methodologies are
capable of quantifying the apportionment of aerosol species to AOD. This study represents
an important case study for the Mediterranean region, with the potential for broader ap-
plications in enhancing aerosol modeling, in models like FARM, given its effectiveness in
quantifying the contributions of different aerosol species to atmospheric attenuation. The
goal is to improve the simulation of AOD in the ENEA modeling systems. In fact, ENEA
provides daily national air quality forecasts for the next three days using the FORAIT-IT
model, as well as European-level forecasts through Copernicus Services, where it is one of
eleven European models in the ensemble. The insights gained from this work could also help
to design air quality policies and strategies to mitigate the impact of aerosols on both human
health and the environment, by separating natural contributions from anthropogenic ones.
